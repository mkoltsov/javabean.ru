I&#8217;m not even sure whom this book is dedicated to. If you&#8217;re a Scala developer then this book is too outdated due to that most of the APIs it explains are either deprecated of heavily rewritten. If you&#8217;re a DevOps&#8230; well, you don&#8217;t read books at all. You can definitely use it as a reference for some of the SBT commands, but there&#8217;re lots of  such references available on the Internet with convenient search by word as well as code examples.

You would definitely find another thing to spend your money on than buying this book.

My score: 2 stars
