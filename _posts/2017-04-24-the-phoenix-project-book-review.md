At first I was really struggling toÂ go through the first one hundred pages as I was constantly bored due to absolute lack of any technical details. However, a good book is always a good book even though it&#8217;s an IT-concerned novel.

What I like in this book is how it reminds some of the actual projects I&#8217;ve worked. I&#8217;m not sure whether the final solution that this book presents will be suitable for anyone but still it gives a lot of food for thought how to improve the inner processes and the workflow in any IT organization. If you like &#8220;The Deadline&#8221; by Tom DeMarco you would love this book.

My score is 3/5, simply because I don&#8217;t like novels.
