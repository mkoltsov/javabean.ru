Since I&#8217;m a book kind of guy I decided that I need to read a book first before writing any code.

This book is an obvious choice since it&#8217;s been recently re-edited and seems to be the only Kafka-related book at the moment. So why not? I decided to give it a try. 1 book &#8211; 1 weekend, what could possibly go wrong?

The first red flag for me was the fact that all the code examples are in Java. How so? Kafka seemed to be an agnostic technology with APIs for both Scala & Java. This might be just a matter of author&#8217;s personal preference. The next red flag was that the code examples are very similar to what is given in official documentation. Nevertheless, i decided to read the book. Thanks to my subscription to Safari Books online library i didn&#8217;t have to pay for it.

Unfortunately, my first impression was right. The book is nothing more than a couple of blog posts contained under a hard cover. Technical details that I utterly needed were not given, instead a lot of Javadocs have been copy-pasted all-around. Code examples are too generic to have any value in them.

Frankly, this video has provided much more than all time i&#8217;ve spent reading the book.
