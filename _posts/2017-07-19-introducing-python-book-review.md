This is actually the first book about Python I&#8217;ve read even though I&#8217;ve used it extensively throughout the years.

My perception that this book proves is that Pythonistas are usually not programmers by trade, they&#8217;d come to programming either due to a lucky coincidence or by taking a wrong turn on the road of career hopping.

This book has promised to give a broad look on the Python&#8217;s ecosystem, it actually delivers on what it promises. But this look is so shallow that I can&#8217;t recommend this book for those who&#8217;s willing to get a deep dive into Python on a weekend. The technical details it gives look like author&#8217;s waving the hands in the air with no actual proof that I&#8217;m used to in Scala and Java books.

Good book, but I can&#8217;t recommendÂ it to any professional programmer who&#8217;s used to technical/programming/mathematical books.

Score 3/5
