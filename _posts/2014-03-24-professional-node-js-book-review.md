I needed a technology that would allow me to build backend as quickly as possible. There were 2 candidates for that: Ruby on Rails and Node.js. I&#8217;m not very proficient with Ruby, because of that learning a JavaScript-based technology was the most obvious choice for me.

The book is great. It&#8217;s neither small nor large. It has a perfect size of 4 hundred pages that can be easily digested throughout the week. Every chapter has an introductory for those who hadn&#8217;t an experience with technology it tells about. I was kinda amused with such small pieces of text about UDP and TCP. I&#8217;ve forgot a lot about the basics of what I usually do.

The book is full of small but useful examples from the real life. If you&#8217;ll cram through the book at a stallion pace (as I did) for the end of the week you would be able to build a small but full functional websites and back end systems using node.js&REST&NoSql. I did it as a hackathon project for less than 5 hours.

My score 5/5
