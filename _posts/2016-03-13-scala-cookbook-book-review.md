Alvin Alexande<img class="alignleft" src="http://akamaicovers.oreilly.com/images/0636920026914/cat.gif" alt="" width="180" height="236" />r has such a nice blog that almost anyone who has a question that has something to do with Scala will definitely end up getting to his website at least once.

I&#8217;ve decided to give his book a try and i didn&#8217;t get disappointed. First I thought I would skim through it in a couple of hours due to relatively easy concepts and redundant information that I might  have known before. Unfortunately (luckily?), that didn&#8217;t happen.

The book is slightly outdated (who needs Scalatra or pure lift-JSON these days?), though delivers a lot of useful concepts that I&#8217;ve happily put under my belt.

My score 4/5

It needs to be updated + I&#8217;d like to remove a lot of worthless water that&#8217;s poured upon you here and there in  the &#8220;Discussion&#8221; parts of every chapter.
