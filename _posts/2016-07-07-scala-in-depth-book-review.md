Is it still relevant? Yes, it is. Apart from a few chapters that&#8217;s dedicated to Actors and collections this book still contains a lot of useful information for an avid Scala-newbie.
  
Am I kidding? Not really. The explanation of type classes that&#8217;s inside of this book is the best that I&#8217;ve ever seen.

Even if you don&#8217;t see a reason to read the book from cover to cover I would recommend  to skim through the &#8220;Type system&#8221; & &#8220;Using implicits&#8221; chapters. They&#8217;re highly comprehensive and will provide you with information that&#8217;ll definitely make your life as a Scala developer easier.

My score 4/5
