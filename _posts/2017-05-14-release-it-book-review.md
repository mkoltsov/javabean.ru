<img class="alignleft " src="https://imagery.pragprog.com/products/93/mnee.jpg?1298589747" width="254" height="305" />There&#8217;s a relatively short list of books I would like to keep on my desk. Most often those books are references and a composition of famous quotes. After I&#8217;ve read this chap I&#8217;d like to have it on my work desk at any moment.

This book is a perfect mix of lots of useful technical insights, practices and recommendations got from the author&#8217;s hard-earned experience combined with some of the soft-skills you need to make your software and its maintenance (which as the author states costs more than the initial 1.0 version) as smooth as possible with as much of interrupted sleep as you could possibly get.

The book is definitely outdated, some of the references to particular technologies look odd and obvious (if not even funny). Nevertheless, I will put this book in one row with the &#8220;SRE book&#8221; & &#8220;Project Phoenix&#8221; as it combines them both.

My score is 5/5
