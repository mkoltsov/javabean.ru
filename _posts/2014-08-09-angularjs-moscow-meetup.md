I&#8217;ve acted as an organizer & moderator for a great discussion considering the future of AngularJS. It was my first experience of organizing an open-space conference, we didn&#8217;t have speakers neither we had a deck of slides. Everyone could share his pain and be able to find relief with help of our community. At the same time we&#8217;ve discussed how each of us use Angular. The most common use case was a CRUD application that collects input parameters for some complicated back end application. Most common used backend stack was Spring, next came the Play! Framework, node.JS had the third place.

We&#8217;ve discussed how cumbersome was web dev during the age of Jquery dominance, how helpful could be a client-based framework that simply abstracts some of the jquery goodnesses.

I plan to host a GDG event for the next time, because of so much people seem to love the same stuff as myself and I want to share my experience with them.
