This book is a great introduction for those who are real new comers, though I thought of myself as of the same kind.

Turns out that&#8217;s not the right book for me as it&#8217;s not focused on particular aspects I&#8217;m interested in (networking, IO). However, it&#8217;s nicely written and it will definitely help if you want to have a high-level view on the most important Bash features.
