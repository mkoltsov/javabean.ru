<img class="alignnone size-medium" src="http://akamaicovers.oreilly.com/images/0636920041528/cat.gif" width="180" height="236" />I don&#8217;t normally buy paper books, which means that in the course of the last few years I&#8217;ve bought only one paper book even though I&#8217;ve read hundreds of books during that period of time. This book is the second one I&#8217;ve bought so far, which means a lot to me. Not mentioning that Google is providing it on the Internet free of charge.

For me, personally, this book is a basis on which a lot of my past assumptions could be argued as viable solutions with the scale of Google. This book is not revealing any Google&#8217;s secrets (do they really have any secrets?) But it&#8217;s a great start even if you don&#8217;t need the scale of Google but want to write robust and failure-resilient apps.

Technical solutions, dealing with the user facing issues, finding peers, on-call support, post-mortems, incident-tracking systems &#8211; this book has it all though, as chapters have been written by different people some aspects are more emphasized than the others. I wish some of the chapters had more gory production-based details than they do now.

My score is 5/5
