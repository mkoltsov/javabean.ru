<p>I'll split this book into 2 main parts: the importance of 1:1s & how to conduct them and depiction of really impressive author's experience after working in multiple high-tech companies where he had to deal with a lot of stress and challenges that're the main attributes of every growing company. </p>

<p>The book is very well-written, if I were in the business of allusions to dishes this particular book would be a molecular caviar. Standing on shoulders of giants of the past, with a pinch of bleeding edge terminology and references to the companies that are hot. </p>

<p>If I condense the whole book in a bullet list, that'd be <ol><li>Conduct 1:1s, no matter what</li><li>Embrace the change, it's inevitable</li><li>Trust to delegate or you'd crumble under load</li><li>Find time to innovate</li><li>Be enthusiastic about what you do and either lead or leave</li><li>Be kind to people</li></ol></p>
<p>My score is 5/5. </p>
