<p>I don't have much to say about this book as it's mostly a compilation of ideas I've either heard or used during my career.</p>

<p>This book can be definitely replaced with a few blog posts. The examples that it gives are rather nonillustrative, I've never heard about most of the companies that the author uses as role models.</p>

<p>Regardless of what I just said the book was nice and easy to read and I really appreciate author's efforts to write it.</p>

<p>I can recommend it as a book you can start and finish during one weekend.</p>

<p>My score 3/5</p>
