I&#8217;<img class="alignleft" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61APhXCksuL._SX258_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" alt="" width="260" height="301" />ve read this book twice before, this is my third time and i still find it appealing. I like how this book is written, how the authors describe sophisticated things in simple terms, what baggage of useful knowledge you obtain after you&#8217;ve read it.

This book is not so easy to read as other books from the &#8220;head first&#8221; series. It&#8217;s 600+ pages long, sometimes you&#8217;ll feel yourself dumb because of complexity of some patterns. But  at the end of the day, after digging through  it you will surely feel enlightened.

Some things are hard to digest, but they would have helped you a lot if you&#8217;d known them before. This book must be read by everyone who had ever thought about designing something from scratch.

My score 5/5
