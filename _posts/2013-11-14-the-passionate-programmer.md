The book doesn&#8217;t try to teach you how\_you\_should\_write\_your_software. On contrary it tries to teach you some things that a normal software developer wouldn&#8217;t think about. Things like &#8220;Mind Reader&#8221;, &#8220;Daily Hit&#8221;, &#8220;. You’ve Already Lost Your Job &#8220;. I like to think of this book as a set of patterns i would consider highly valuable.

I made a list of that patterns and i&#8217;ll try to stick to it =)

My score is 5 out of 5
