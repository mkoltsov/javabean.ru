<p>Well, if you're looking for a brief introduction to ML that book could be of some use for you. Unfortunately, it doesn't go far beyond that.</p>

<p>Code examples that are bundled with the book have-not been updated for a long time, therefore some of them don't work.</p>

<p>I reckon that If you had read a few blog posts from 2017 titled "Introduction to Machine Learning" with no Ruby code examples you would have known more than what this book teaches you.</p>

<p>My score is 3/5</p>
