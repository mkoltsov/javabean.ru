Ruby (along with Python and Javascript) is a kind of a language that allows you to use it without dropping a sweat to study it. That&#8217;s what has happened to me. I&#8217;ve been using Ruby for a while, but haven&#8217;t read anything but blog posts about it.

This book gave me a good momentum to start using some of the Ruby features I (i.e. Fibers ) that I was Â completely unaware before, though the amount of input it provides is not overwhelming which helps you to digest this book over a weekend.

That&#8217;s a good starter for anyone willing to start coding in Ruby 2.1, lots of examples are outdated if you aim for Ruby 2.4+

My score 4/5
