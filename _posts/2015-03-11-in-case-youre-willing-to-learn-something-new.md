After 2 year pause the most disruptive course i&#8217;ve ever attended is offered again. Unfortunately i didn&#8217;t finish it last time, which is pretty challenging for me. The course is taught in Scala but most of the concepts are not Scala-specific. If you enjoy functional programming this course will take you to a next level. Recommended by the <a href="http://www.lambdadays.org/" target="_blank">LambdaDays</a>  attendees.

# <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-big-data-apache-spark-uc-berkeleyx-cs100-1x#.VQDMH4HF-24" target="_blank">Introduction to Big Data with Apache Spark</a> {.course-detail-title}

I was told about this course on <a href="http://spark-summit.org/2014" target="_blank">Spark Summit</a> in San Francisco last summer. Spark was invented in Berkeley, therefore i would believe that these guy truly knows what&#8217;s Big Data. If you&#8217;re curious enough and willing to hone your Python skills i would recommend you to enroll to this course.
