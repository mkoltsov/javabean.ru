I always thought of myself as of a quick learner, therefore I prefer to practice and hone my skill rather than reading long and lenghty books.

But this book is an exception. It's not long, it's not boring. But after reading it I felt unsatisfied as the code examples were far from what's needed in the real life, some parts of the language are shallowly described and the whole impression of the language it gives is that Go is very close to Javascript and you can easily learn it over the weekend.

Unfortunately, that's not the case with Go. I'll give a try to "Go in Practice" from the same publisher in a hope that it will not leave me with lots of unanswered questions as this book did.

My score is 2/5
