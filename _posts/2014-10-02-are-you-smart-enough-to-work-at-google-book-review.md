First I should say that this book is not a step by step manual for acquiring a job at Google. It&#8217;s more an updated version of the author&#8217;s previous book &#8220;How to move mount Fuji&#8221;. This book is full of mind-blowing puzzles and quizzes that the top notch tech companies use to ask during their interviews. At the same time it&#8217;s not an encyclopedia, it gives you an exciting insight of the interview process at Google. The author had spent a lot of time interviewing recruiters/interviewers/interviewees to get to a point where he can explain why the interviews have become what they are.
  
The book is really interesting from scientific point of view, you can get there answers to many rhetoric questions that were asked centuries ago. My favorite question was asked by Newton :&#8221;Where a man can swim faster: through water or syrup?&#8221;. It had taken few hundred years to get an answer for this question. This book is full of amazing puzzles like this that would definitely help you to develop your analytical thinking.

The only flaw of this book is a fact that it&#8217;s not very practical, you would forget most  what you&#8217;d read in a couple of days =)

My score 4/5
