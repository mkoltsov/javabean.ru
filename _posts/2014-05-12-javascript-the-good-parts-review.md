These days I &#8216;ve been struggling a lot because of my incompetence. Many cool JS frameworks (except for jQuery which was a starting point for most of them) and Node.js made me learn JavaScript on a such level that I won&#8217;t be shy to show my code to anyone.

In the Java world there&#8217;s a book that every pragmatic developer should read , it&#8217;s Joshua Bloch&#8217;s &#8220;Effective Java&#8221;. This book has the same uplifting effect, if you would have read it. It teaches how you SHOULD write js code. After reading it I have a strong belief that JavaScript has much more common with Scala and Lisp, than it has with Java.

My score 5/5
