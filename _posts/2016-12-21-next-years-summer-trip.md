This year we were on the beautiful Adriatic coastline as well as we toured most of magnificent Italy, astonishing Croatia, and most importantly Slovenia that completely stole my heart as it&#8217;s the most beautiful country I&#8217;ve been so far.

Next year the plan is to meet our peers in Bulgaria along with visiting the birthplace of Slavic culture in Greece, not to mention checking out Macedonian wine and probably Belgrade will look better while the sun is shining there.
