<img class="alignleft" src="http://commonsware.com/images/books/android_development.png" alt="cover" width="137" height="177" />This year i&#8217;ve tried to give Android as a developmnent platform a second try. Previously i had a harsh experience with it, mostly because of the fact that it&#8217;s environment was inmature. Eclipse with it&#8217;s sophisticated Android plugin and Ant were not helping me in keeping sanity at all. It was a mess! Everytime i was executing Android&#8217;s emulator my Macbook Pro was acting as it was a typewriter with no multitasking at all.

This time everything has changed. Android&#8217;s dev Â tools became very mature, as well as the Android&#8217;s ecosystem.

Basically, i had to start from scratch in the Android learning process. It&#8217;s learning curve is very lean, but at the same time Android&#8217;s API is very broad and it&#8217;s still constantly changing.

This book is a perfect solution, it consists of 2000+ pages! It covers most of the topics i had to deal with. It has a <a href="https://github.com/commonsguy/cw-omnibus" target="_blank">Github</a> repository, which has a enormous broadth of examples! From simple activities to dealing with NDK, this book has a chapter and a code to tackle in.

My only issue with it is the price. Currently it costs more than <a href="http://commonsware.com/Android/" target="_blank">40 bucks</a>, which is kinda huge for an ebook. I had my concerns with it, that&#8217;s why i went on with a free outdated version. If i&#8217;ll find a way to make some money with Android, i&#8217;ll totally buy a full version which is updated with every major Android release!

My score 5/5
