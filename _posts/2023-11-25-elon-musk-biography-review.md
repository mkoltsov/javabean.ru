<p>I've binged-read this book cover to cover in less than a week. I don't remember much about what was happening over the last 7 days besides taking a first look at illustrations in Barnes&Noble to turning the last page. </p>

<p>This book feels like a not-so-short digest of most exciting things that've happened over the last two decades: from dotcom boom of early 2000's to the AI boom and Twitter meltdown. It's fascinating to be told that you've witnessed a whole epoch all lead by a bunch of folks squeezed between San Jose and San Francisco. A true power house built by engineers and techno visioneers that radiates its ideas to the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Personally, I find this book an ode to the American Dream. How thanks to hard work and dedication someone can really change the mankind's history by being the right person at the right time. Trully, an epitome to the American Dream. </p>
<p> My score is 5/5. </p>
