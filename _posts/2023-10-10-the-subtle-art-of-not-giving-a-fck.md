<p>I resented reading this book due to its notoriety and agressive marketing across both online and offline. This wasn't worth it. </p>

<p>It's very surprising that's not one of Tim Ferriss' books, looks like the author has a background similar to Tim's and was inspired by him as well. However, this book gives answers and most Tim's books left me with more questions than before I started to read them. I wish I read this book in my early 20s, but having learned most of its content the hard way makes me appreciate this book even more as it resonates a lot with my life experience.</p>

<p>If I condense the whole book in a bullet list, that'd be <ol><li>Conduct 1:1s, no matter what</li><li>Embrace the change, it's inevitable</li><li>Trust to delegate or you'd crumble under load</li><li>Find time to innovate</li><li>Be enthusiastic about what you do and either lead or leave</li><li>Be kind to people</li></ol></p>
<p>My score is 5/5. </p>
