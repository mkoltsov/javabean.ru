From my point of view, this book should be considered not more than a manual listing most of the features of ECMAscript 2015 with examples. It&#8217;s not yet finished, but imho i doubt that it will be more than a list of features.

On the other side, it can save you a lot of time if you&#8217;re looking for one place to get familiarized with most of the new constructions that were added to JS recently and you&#8217;re not in a mood to chase a lot of blog posts dispersed throughout the Internet.

My score (book is still 60% complete, hence this is not a final score) 3/5
