<img class="alignleft " src="https://www.packtpub.com/sites/default/files/7481OS_cov_0.jpg" width="169" height="209" />The book provides only a shallow knowledge of Puppet, doesn&#8217;t cover some of the most important modules you&#8217;ll need in the real world as well as it doesn&#8217;t provide practical examples.

I will recommend it only if you need to quickly brush up the technical details of Puppet&#8217;s architecture or you need to start using it quickly rather than spending some time on playing with examples its documentation provides

My score: 3/5
