<p>The most valuable asset that this book gives is its reading list given at the very end of it.</p>

<p>Tim Ferriss is a cool guy with a long list of achievements, I just don't agree with some of the things written in this book. Plus, as it was written in 2007 a lot of stuff that he tries to explain in detail like the easiness of creating your own info products and remote work ubiquity are considered as trivial and don't need a lengthy multi chapter explanation as, I assume, was the case in 2007. </p>

<p>The "low information diet" principle coined by Ferriss will take a place at the top of my own list of the things that I strive to do for self improvement.</p>

<p>My score is 3/5</p>
