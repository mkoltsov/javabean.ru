There&#8217;s a certain lack of books for the Glass explorers. The fact that this book exists is a delightful exception. The book exactly does what it promises. An ability to develop web apps for Google glass. Though there is a lot of manuals from Google to achieve such a goal, but I feel confident after reading a book that&#8217;s not affiliated with a certain vendor. Vendor&#8217;s books tend to lie, that&#8217;s the main point after years of tackling distinct API&#8217;s.

Apart from that the the book is great, it teaches you how to make it with Google glass in a succinct way. It can be easily read in a couple of days. My only issue with it was a lack of material covering the native development process for the goggles. If all you need is mirror api than this book is sufficient, but if you feel pain because of the mirror api handicaps I recommend you to find another book which covers GDK.

My score is 3/5
