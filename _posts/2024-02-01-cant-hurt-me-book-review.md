<p>I had to force myself to start reading this book due to the amount of explicit language used by the author.  That's probably the first book I've read in more than 20 years that contains curse words. However, I don't think that the kids will be reading it. As an adult I'm fine with that.</p>

<p>Author's story of starting from the bottom has really touched my soul. In today's world where people are often avoiding the difficulties by all means this book is really pushing the idea of "what doesn't kill you makes you stronger" to the limits of what a human can do by making the reader to embrace the failures. Every failure should make you calloused so next time you fail it won't hurt you.</p>

<p>What's also really interesting is how the author was able to completely avoid bringing any right or left ideology to his book. Given his background as a Navy recruiter and the fact that the author ruminates on the subject of how his despises weak people I really love that the book is clear of politics.</p>

<p>My score 5/5</p>
