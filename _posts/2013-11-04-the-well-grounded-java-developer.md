This book&#8217;s authors tried to write an all-around guide for the new coming Java developers.
  
But Java is too broad to cover all the different topics in just one book.
  
That&#8217;s the main problem with this book: an attempt to include everything that they could in 400 pages.
  
The book is great! There&#8217;s no other book that starts from low-level options of Java NIO and ends with a high-end view on current set of Java web frameworks.
  
Was it necessary? I doubt.

From my perspective it&#8217;s impossible to do what authors intended to do.
  
Java is a language that has been evolving for more than 15 years. It has an army of adopters, enormous amount of frameworks and a huge set of JVM-based languages.
  
I bet that you should read this book only if you&#8217;re a fresh grad that&#8217;s eagerly searches to land on a first job.
  
I agree with author&#8217;s choice of languages and frameworks that they tell about in their book. But is this set crucial for EVERY java developer. I doubt.

My score is 3 of 5
