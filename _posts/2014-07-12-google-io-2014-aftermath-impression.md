Yesterday i was giving a talk summarizing all the new things i&#8217;ve learned throughout the conference. It was real fun! I put emphasis onto things i consider as the most prominent : Dart, Polymer, Dataflow. After the talk i had an interesting conversation about the future of AngularJS considering the rise of Polymer. I was a little nervous because i couldn&#8217;t see the audience, but the comments and questions were very nice.

I didn&#8217;t have enough time to prepare, so i&#8217;ve decided to include some of the slides from the conference. Here&#8217;s my [presentation](http://tiny.cc/aftermathio).
