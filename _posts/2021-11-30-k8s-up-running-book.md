<p>This is a review for the second edition of K8S U&R, even though early access for the third edition is already available on some of the platforms.</p>

<p>Reading this book feels like walking in a park. Almost no code snippets to follow, no excruciating technical details. Read yamls and a very few imperative CLI commands. If all books for system administrators are like that, I'm curious, why the OPS guys are paid on the same level with developers.</p>

<p>Speaking of the book itself, I can't say that I've learned much from it. It definitely covers all the basics and gives a few tips.</p>

<p>Definitely better than the manual, better skip it if you already know the basics.</p>

<p>My score is 3/5</p>
