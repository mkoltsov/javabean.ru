My wife needed some Windows specific software on her laptop, so i had to install it. My choice was obvious, because the last OS from Microsoft i&#8217;ve used was XP. Installing VirtualBox on Xubuntu -> Downloading XP & Office through MSDN -> Installing it & some minor tweaks took me a couple of hours.

Wow! Windows XP consumes resources next to nothing! Windows 7 & Windows 8 are enormous computer performance suckers! Windows xp can live on 256 mb of RAM! That&#8217;s unbelievable!

My final thought is that if you&#8217;ll ever need a small windows computer beast consider XP as a perfect candidate!
