My major was information security, but since I&#8217;ve graduated a lot of things have changed in a field of security. New crypto algorithms have emerged, some of perimeter security patterns have changed. I try to brush up me IS skills from time to time, because I still find security as the most exciting(but not so valued by the managers) thing in IT for me.

This book is not an exception. I&#8217;ve been using an open source library which abstracts usage of OAUTH 2.0 and I was curios about the specs that this library is based on.<img class="aligncenter" src="https://playground.theteamie.com/sites/playground.theteamie.com/files/My-Endpoints.png" alt="" width="345" height="308" />

This book is the perfect destination if you&#8217;ve come for specs. It covers oauth&#8217;12 draft verbosely. Though there are some code snippets written in PHP in Python (which was OK in 2012, but it&#8217;s not in 2014 when JS is the most widespread language), they are so brief and out of scope of today&#8217;s implementation that I&#8217;ll suggest not use them at all.

Albeit the author is a Google employee the book covers some other (mostly Facebook&#8217;s) implementations also.

My score is 3/5.

Use this book as a reference, don&#8217;t spend much time trying to understand everything from it.
