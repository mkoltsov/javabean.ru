As the goal was set I had to find out what will be the best approach to achieve it. Trying to comprehend all these Fluxes, Reduxes & Immutable. JS  through a course of a couple of days seemed impossible to me. Since I&#8217;m usually a book-type of guy, at first I&#8217;ve decided to read a book &#8230; and then BOOM &#8230;  i&#8217;m a seasoned React pro. <img class="alignleft" src="https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcShiZEL66bo_F19k_-KX7zVctAPLX4WFoCbsrxwPyrojvtz7Hay" alt="" width="196" height="257" />

To make a long story short, that didn&#8217;t happen. This book can definitely help you to comprehend the basics of using a new framework, but these days it&#8217;s not sufficient due to so called &#8220;Javascript fatigue&#8221;, which can be described in simple terms as a never ending flood of JS-frameworks & libraries you need to learn to comprehend a recently written webapp.

The book is good for beginners, for whom it might be their first introduction to the world of modern apps. Learning the basics didn&#8217;t give me much since React has a pretty lean learning curve, which doesn&#8217;t require anything but any knowledge of Javascript.

&nbsp;

The thing that gave me a lot of pain was Redux, which is de-facto standard in writing React apps these days. Unfortunately the book doesn&#8217;t contain much about it apart from its mentioning as well as a link to a Github repo with an app written with Redux in mind.

<a href="http://teropa.info/blog/2015/09/10/full-stack-redux-tutorial.html" target="_blank">This</a> manual has helped me more, but to be fair, it&#8217;s dedicated to Redux(however, it also explains most of the essential React basics you&#8217;d need to be productive). I also reckon that it&#8217;s much more lengthier than the reviewed book.

As a Scala developer I find React + Redux very exciting. It&#8217;s hard to overestimate how important it is to base front-end apps on robust architecture, which Redux+React helps you to do by obliging  you to use some of the best glimpses of Functional programming.
