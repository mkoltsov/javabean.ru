As Docker continues to keep its pace as a constantly evolving technology, there&#8217;s no book that encompasses all aspects of it. In my opinion, this book came close to that. Though sometimes it doesn&#8217;t provide you all technical details it covers a lot of what you need to deal with Docker on a daily basis.

I found the examples that come with the book are so  helpful that even sometimes I could even use them in order to improve some aspects of my daily routine.

The book covers docker 1.8, which API hasn&#8217;t changed so much since the book has been written. But some of the networking APIs, docker compose has slightly changed which allows to give this book only 4 stars. Apart from that it&#8217;s not  a constantly updated book I can recommend it to anyone who considers Docker as a viable technology.
