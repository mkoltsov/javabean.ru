Some say that this book is a cornerstone for every developer. Unfortunately, I&#8217;ve approached it just recently, so it won&#8217;t affect me much.  As for me, this book is just a lousy interpretation of other books i&#8217;ve read plus an excerpt from the author&#8217;s experience that every mature developer will find obvious.

I would recommend this book to any junior developer in case he/she hasn&#8217;t read any other codestyle-concerned book like Josh Bloch&#8217;s &#8220;Effective Java&#8221;.

My score 3/5
