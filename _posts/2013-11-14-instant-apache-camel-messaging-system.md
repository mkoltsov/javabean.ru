Here&#8217;s a deal that some of the software developers face with on a daily basis. You see someone&#8217;s code that you have no idea how to work with. Maybe be because of lack of knowledge/frameworks/time constrains, you choose.

What&#8217;s the best practices how to deal with such a problem? You can dig in that code and spend a bunch of time to understand how it works. As you gain more experience you&#8217;ll know that there&#8217;s another path. As a pragmatic programmer i try to teach myself before i&#8217;ll get stuck in an awkward situation.

My problems were couple of frameworks i&#8217;ve never used. I didn&#8217;t have too much time to learn all about them, so i&#8217;ve decided to study them in an easy way. I started to dig myself into Apache Camel.

Packpub is a some sort of a mad publisher. They issued 2 books about Camel this year almost at the same time. I choosed this particular book simply because it was a little bit longer. It has 78 pages!

Ok, this book doesn&#8217;t try to teach all the bells and whistles Apache Camel can get you. But it&#8217;s a perfect source if you want to start as quickly as possible. The book can be read in a couple of hours! That&#8217;s mad! Every chapter has a link if you need to learn something deeper.

My score is 4 of 5
