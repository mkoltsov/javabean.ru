In my opinion, it might be that in the very beginning, but currently most of the concepts that it presents are obvious and outdated.

I will recommend it to be read to someone who&#8217;s new in the DevOps community, but if you&#8217;ve got a few years of experience in the area under your belt I would   not.

It&#8217;s nice to have all good concepts under one cover, but reading a 400-pages long book that will tell you the history of GIT and SVN is pointless in my opinion. Most of the ideas presented in the book could be wrapped in one long yet succinct blog post.

My score 3/5
