It&#8217;s also complimentary to the &#8220;Phoenix Project&#8221; written by the same authors.

If you&#8217;ve skipped the &#8220;Phoenix Project&#8221; or you don&#8217;t like to read the novels, like I do, I would recommend you to start with this book as it has much more momentum than the first book.

It has a bunch of great inspiring examples of successes from the companies that have embarked on the &#8220;DevOps journey&#8221; which to me is the best part of this book. Also the book is relatively recent therefore a lot of its advices are quite innovative and might be even disturbing to some.

My score 4/5
