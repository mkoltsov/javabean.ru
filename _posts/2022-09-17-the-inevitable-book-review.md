<p>This book was recommended on one of Motley Fool's shows as a visionary book that perfectly describes what the future holds for us in terms of technological progress.</p>

<p>Well, after reading it I'm pretty sure that the person that recommended it is not an engineer. That's not a book from any well-known futurist, rather from a tech reporter that keeps his hand on pulse of latest and greatest tech. He doesn't peek in the distant future, instead he's trying to find what trends will prevail in the following decades. AR/AI/VR, yada yada yada. Pretty boring if you ask me. I liked one point though: the word "protopia" that's a shorter way to say that the only constant is change. </p>

<p>My score is 2/5. Better read a bunch of twitter posts by Elon Musk</p>
