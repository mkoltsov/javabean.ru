You can start small, read a couple of first chapters and you&#8217;d be good to go using it everyday without any problems at all. But if you&#8217;ll dedicate a bit more time into reading it and executing tons of examples that come with it you&#8217;ll become a die-hard Elasticsearch professional without you even noticing that =)

As I&#8217;ve said the book is very well written, although some parts of it are a bit outdated which definitely adds more sense to try to run the examples by yourself in order to check whether they work on current release or not.

My score 5/5
