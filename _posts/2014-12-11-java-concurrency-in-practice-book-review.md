It was quiet easy to review this book, because i try to re-read it every year and it had became a necessity for me. Some parts of it are not easy to comprehend but at the end of the day this book can teach you what no other book could.

This time i&#8217;ve created a [repository](https://github.com/mkoltsov/ConcurrencyInPractice)Â that contains most of the examples. In my experience writing code helps me much more than reading code.

My score 5/5
