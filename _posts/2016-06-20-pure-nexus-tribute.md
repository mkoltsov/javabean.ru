Pure Nexus was the best thing that has happened to my tablet & phone since the moment that I&#8217;ve rooted them. It retains the pure Nexus experience, but dissolves all the unnecessary crap that Google tends to install on its &#8220;flagman&#8221; phones.

After installing it memory consumption has significantly dropped as well as battery life improvement has been obtained. All the necessary widgets I got used to areÂ already there pre-installed, so it has helped me to get rid of some stuff I was struggling to take with me on every phone (i. e. yahoo weather widget).
