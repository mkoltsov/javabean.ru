[This](http://www.baeldung.com/rest-with-spring-series/) 40+ pages manuscript shouldn&#8217;t be considered as a book, but it&#8217;s author insists to call it so.
  
<img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.baeldung.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/if-java-is-the-engine-then-spring-is-the-fuel.jpg" alt="" width="793" height="681" />Â There&#8217;s a certain lack of materials covering building a robust Rest API with Spring. Most of the manuals I&#8217;ve seen operate with JAX-RS, which Spring MVC doesn&#8217;t conform to.

There&#8217;s also a great talk by the creator of Apache Shiro which I would recommend to anyone striving to do a scalable web service regardless of particular language/technology you use.
  


I&#8217;ve been doing web services for a long time using different technologies (node, Clojure to name a few). I always try to do it as efficient as I can. This time I had an issue while integrating security layer into Spring MVC.

To make a long story short, this book is a waste of time:
  
It&#8217;s huge, some parts of it are repeating. I have no idea why the author has intended to do so much copy-paste
  
Some postulates are not true. Though Spring security 3.2 had a java config this book says that it hadn&#8217;t.
  
It doesn&#8217;t cover features of Spring 4 at all. The author has forgotten to update his book. Albeit he aggressively promotes it.

For a free ebook it&#8217;s not awful, but i would definitely recommend you to find some other book.
