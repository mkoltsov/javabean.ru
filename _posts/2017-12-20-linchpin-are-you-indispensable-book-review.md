<p>This book doesn't reinvent the wheel, it will not teach you anything new that you haven't heard of before. This is simply a cookbook of recipes on how to always stay relevant and drift with the flow in the right direction.</p>

<p>Very motivating, if you're a fan of Lifehacker that's definitely the book you need to read instantly.</p>

<p>My score is 5/5</p>
