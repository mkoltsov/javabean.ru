<p>It's fair to say that I'm a big fan of all what Joshua Bloch does. Therefore it shouldn't be a surprise that I've read all his books. Unfortunately, I noticed that there's a new edition of "Effective Java" only this year even though it originally came in 2017.</p>

<p>The difference between the second and the third editions in huge. Besides the chapters that have never existed before due to obvious reason that java had no Lambdas, Streams and Functional Interfaces before Java 8 a lot of work has been done to rewrite the items that were there already. As we strive to follow the pace of technology some things that were considered essential before become obsolete.</p>

<p>The best illustration of that thesis is the "Serialization" chapter. In the beginning of the chapter Bloch clearly warns his readers: "Better stay away from internal Java serialization API and go with either JSON or profobuff." Such fairness with readers is invaluable and can hardly be seen today.</p>

<p>I've really become interested in Streams after reading this book.</p>

<p>There's just one problem with this book. I wish it would take less than a decade for this book to get its new edition next time. Prior to that every new "Effective Java" book came after almost a decade-long hiatus.<p>

<p>My score for this book is 5/5</p>
