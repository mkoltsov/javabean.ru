<p>I don't usually play video games, but the Battlefield series got me hooked during my days at school. I've never played it online, instead I always preferred the single player flavor of it</p>

<p>Battlefield 1 looked like a disaster to me, though it had historically precise arms and vehicles its single player looked unbelievably lackluster in comparison with what the players were given in Battlefield 3/4/Hardline. It was OKish, but looked more like a tutorial to all the bells and whistles that the game had. That was the first Battlefield that I hadn't completed as it was tood boring to my taste. How wrong I was back in those days.</p>

<p>Battlefield V has the worst single player across the whole Battlefield series. Yes, the decorations are nice, the arms and vehicles are there. But apart from one "chapter" every other part of it can be described as overwhelming waves of foes that you need to go kill in order to finish the game. That's it, no scenario at all.  </p>

<p>Battlefield V is a good benchmark for your videocard, but I'd not recommend anyone to play its single player if the one doesn't want to be disappointed.</p>
