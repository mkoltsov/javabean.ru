I know a half of a dozen of different languages, among them I use 3 of them on a daily basis. Even though I&#8217;ve started to learn most of them relatively early due to lack of practice and absence of communication with native speakers my accent is thick. I also do a lot of typical mistakes influenced by my native Slavic language (i.e. I miss the nouns most of the time when I use Germanic-based languages).

But what has recently struck me is that if you know more that one foreign language and you use them day-to-day some tumbler in your head switches and suddenly you&#8217;re able to absorb new languages by means of pure anticipation and understanding of common principles that all languages are based upon.

Interestingly, the same idea has struck my daughter who&#8217;s already multilingual even though she&#8217;s only 5. I wonder how many languages will she be able to speak whilst she&#8217;ll be my age.
