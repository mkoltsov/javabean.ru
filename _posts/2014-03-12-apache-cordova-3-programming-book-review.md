<img class="alignleft" title="cover" src="http://www.cordovaprogramming.com//images/acp-cover-160.png" alt="" width="160" height="209" />I&#8217;m learning if Cordova is able to solve the problems I&#8217;ve struggled with while developing an app using the native approach of Mobile Development.

I&#8217;ve watched a video course on Lynda.com, but it wasn&#8217;t a remedy. Screen casts can be easily digested, but I can hardly remember a thing after some time has passed.

That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve bought this book. Basically, the Cordova programming book disappointed me. The book contains a bunch of examples that can by found on its github repository for free and two hundred and a half pages that are completely useless because all the information they contain can be found on Apache Cordova website for less than nothing.

Actually some tips were useful, but a single blog post would be a more suitable form for them.

My score 2/5
