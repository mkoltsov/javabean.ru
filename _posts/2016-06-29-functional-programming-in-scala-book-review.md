I reckon that&#8217;s not doable during the coarse of a few hundred pages. Fortunately, this book delivers that what it has promised.

All the book&#8217;s materials are split into the chunks of textual information and exercises you&#8217;re encouraged to do in order to fully absorb all the meaningful information you might otherwise forget in a day.Since starting to read I understood a lot of concepts that previously I thought of as too complex for me which made my life a lot easier and my code better.

Unfortunately, I&#8217;ve found that the most important parts of the book were 5 first chapters as well as 3 last chapters. Besides these chapters I got lost trying to digest some of the concepts that this book has tried to teach me. Apparently that has something to do with the amount of exercises you need to complete to make a progress with this book. I&#8217;ve spent more than 2 months in reading and doing the book&#8217;s exercises, which was a real exhaustive experience and made me glad that finally I&#8217;ve finished this book without abandoning it due to frustration.

My score is 4/5. Authors need to grasp more teaching experience to make their book easier to comprehend and get rid of some useless exercises but keep all the important ones.
