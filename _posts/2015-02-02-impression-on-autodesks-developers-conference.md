IÂ thought of Autodesk as a product company that&#8217;s interested in selling of theirs products instead of growing a community of loyal developers. I was completely wrong, Autodesk treats developers as first-class citizens. Guys from Autodesk were friendly and willing to tell us as much as NDA permits about their current <a href="http://viewer.autodesk.io/node/gallery/#/gallery" target="_blank">technology platform</a>. I was primarily focused on technologies that they use to do 3D-models for the web, and they&#8217;d given me enough information to consider Autodesk as a big player in the 3D-visualization field.<img class="alignnone" src="http://habrastorage.org/files/908/c36/ed1/908c36ed14074541bebf0dc00b7fd3ee.JPG" alt="" width="1920" height="1280" />

At the same time me & <a href="http://www.meetup.com/WeMakeWeb/members/183109287/" target="_blank">Andrey Kasatkin</a> were invited to the conference to share some of our engineering expertise. We were told that attendees don&#8217;t know much about the current state of technology, excluding Autodesk&#8217;s. I&#8217;m not sure about that, because in general questions from the audience were meaningful and sometimes even challenging. Most of the conferences I&#8217;ve been there&#8217;s always a .NET guy who&#8217;s trying to convince everyone that only MS knows how to do serious things, this one wasn&#8217;t an exception. I don&#8217;t know how Microsoft does that, but it&#8217;s embarrassing to tell someone that there&#8217;s a lot of other technologies to consider that these guys are reluctant to hear about.<img class="alignnone" src="http://habrastorage.org/files/d72/c42/0a3/d72c420a33f9448e9795baa862eaec5e.JPG" alt="" width="1920" height="1280" />

We had a lot of fun.<img class="alignnone" src="http://habrastorage.org/files/991/589/d2c/991589d2c3fe4f9f8d670af598eed0fa.JPG" alt="" width="1920" height="1280" /><img class="alignnone" src="http://habrastorage.org/files/3c9/868/786/3c98687861b745fc9151c907fb4bd486.JPG" alt="" width="1920" height="1280" />
