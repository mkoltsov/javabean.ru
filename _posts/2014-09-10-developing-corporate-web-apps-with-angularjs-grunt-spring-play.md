I&#8217;ll be giving a talk about the process of developing corporate single page apps next Saturday(20.09) in Kazan. 

The talk will be mostly about my experience as a developer, tradeoffs that i had to pay developing &#8220;thick web apps&#8221; using Angular and lots of its complementary modules. I&#8217;ll talk a little bit about developing Rest api that suits most of the corporate restrictions. If there&#8217;ll be no backend devs i won&#8217;t emphasize on it. 

Wish me a good luck!
