I love meetups! I like to meet new people and learn new things. Last but not least it&#8217;s a great opportunity to make new friends.

Last Tuesday we had a third meetup at Luxoft Moscow. This time we&#8217;ve talked about web apps full-spectrum testing and how to synchronize the data between a server and a client using the MEAN stack. Andrey Kasatkin did a great talk on how to minimize the data flow using compulsory caching. We&#8217;ve talked about **AngularJS, Node.JS, Java, TDD, Selenium, PhantomJS, Scala, highload, patterns of building robust web apps**.

It was really interesting to discuss some things that i&#8217;d never thought of, like comparison of concurrency patterns in Java and PHP.  [Igor Sysoev](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Sysoev) who came to our meetup was as solid as rock =)

I believe there&#8217;ll be more meetups soon&#8230;
