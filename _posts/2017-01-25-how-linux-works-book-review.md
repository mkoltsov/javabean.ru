It&#8217;s easy to read, though it encompasses lots of useful information. I wish my first Linux book was like that.

The only complaint I had with it was that though its second edition has been recently issued and it wasn&#8217;t strictly specified on which Linux distribution should I run some of the commands from the book  I wasn&#8217;t able to try some of them due to that there were no such packages in the APT repository for reference Ubuntu Docker image I&#8217;ve been using.

This is definitely not a book I would recommend to a SysOps, unless he needs to quickly brush-up his skills. But if you&#8217;re a &#8220;superuser&#8221;, that&#8217;s the book you should definitely read to know what&#8217;s &#8220;inode&#8221; any why top&vmstat&iotop might be much more powerful than you&#8217;ve thought.

My score 4/5
