After passing the certification I felt that I have been completely wrong since the beginning =)

The reason for my confidence was that I contribute to <a href="http://Spark Packages" target="_blank">spark-packages</a> as well as to some Spark-related OSS projects (i.e. <a href="https://zeppelin.incubator.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache Zeppelin</a>), apart from the fact that I&#8217;m using Spark for more than a year now and I&#8217;ve been on the first <a href="https://spark-summit.org/2014/" target="_blank">Spark Summit</a> and a number of Spark-related meetups in London. <img class="alignleft" src="http://akamaicovers.oreilly.com/images/0636920028512/cat.gif" alt="" width="180" height="236" />I thought that&#8217;d be more than enough just to skim a recommended &#8220;Learning Spark&#8221; book by one of the Spark&#8217;s creators before the exam.

I wish I had at least read the impressions of those who&#8217;d gone to the exam before me =)

I can definitely say that it&#8217;s one of the toughest IT certifications I&#8217;ve ever passed. O&#8217;reilly & Databricks have really put a lot of emphasis on practical experience that can&#8217;t be read anywhere and can&#8217;t be constituted without deep digging into the framework internals. I had no experience with Spark on YARN since I was using it mostly on Mesos cluster or in standalone mode, which made me drop a lot of sweat =)

If I had been looking for a new developer with Spark experience I would surely have given him a number of points if he has this certificate. It&#8217;s really based on practical experience, but not on theoretical knowledge which makes passing it valuable.
