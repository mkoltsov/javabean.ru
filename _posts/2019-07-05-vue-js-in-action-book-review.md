<p>Recently I didn't have much time to read books due to various personal reasons and that's why I was so excited to read this book when I finally got time to do that.</p>

<p>To be honest that's not the first Vue.js book I've read. A year and something ago I've read a good enough book <a src="https://www.amazon.com/Vue-js-Bootstrap-Web-Development-Responsive/dp/1788290925/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=vue+bootstrap&qid=1562345101&s=books&sr=1-1">Vue.js 2 and Bootstrap 4 Web Development</a>. Back then I was playing with Vue in my spare time and didn't get an opportunity to use it anywhere besides my small pet projects. The book was okayish though it didn't cover the fundamental technical areas of Vue I was mostly interested in. But it was good enough for a starter. This particular book from Manning is a completely different story.</p>

<p>This book follows the software book standard of writing that never gets old. It starts from the high level architecture overview and then digs to the very bottom of its implementation. This process is accompanied with practical exercises where you get to write code yourself and all of this is followed by inspiring home assignments.</p>

<p>I had to rush with reading this book as I needed to write a Vue project for my work in just a week. But this book allowed me to reduce practically all the technical debt I've acquired during this process. </p>	

<p>The examples given in this book were relevant to what I did at work so I was able to use what I just learned in practice. </p>

<p>My impression on Vue is that it's one of the most beginner's friendly frontend frameworks I've worked with. And this book adds even more to that. It explains most Vue concepts in great detail and almost always you get a practical example of it plus a best practice pattern that you can follow.</p>

<p>My score for this book is 5/5</p>
