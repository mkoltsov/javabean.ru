I&#8217;ve abandoned it for a while, but this fall it was finally released thus I no other excuse to finally finish reading it.

I need to confess that&#8217;s not the first Akka book I&#8217;ve read so far. By no means this book covers all the aspects of Akka (which is enormously huge, albeit allows you to write full fledged applications based only on itself). But it is **THE BOOK **I would recommend you to read if you&#8217;re interested in Akka right now. The book has been recently updated to reflect the latest changes in  http, persistence and some other modules. Taking into account how quickly does akka keep its pace I would say that after a while without constant updates (which took this book 4 years to get finished) this book could get outdated.

It has the bulk of the info you need to know about Akka to start working with it and get productive. Code that comes on its Github really works (which is rare for books&#8217; code examples) and it can help you get your hands dirty in parts of the AKKA as quickly as possible.

My score is 4/5(I recommend to start reading it right now until it&#8217;s too late)
