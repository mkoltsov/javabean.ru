<p>We had one and off relationships with <a href="https://brave.com/" target="_blank">Brave</a> before, but I couldn't jump off the Google's dreadnought as I had problems with using email with Brave.</p>

<p>The wait is over. After watching how convinient Protonmail is on my collegue's laptop and mobile I decided that it's my turn to fully embrace Brave as well as the ability to read my emails without being constantly watched by Google with a goal to serve me better ads</p>

<p>Bye bye Gmail, bye bye Chrome</p>

<p>Privacy is Key</p>
