<img class="alignleft" src="https://www.ng-book.com/images/flatbook-ngbook-small.png" alt="cover" width="320" height="421" />I have to admit that this book is the most complete manual for AngularJS. I haven&#8217;t had an opportunity to read it from cover to cover, though I use it as a manual very often.

Most of the topics that I&#8217;ve referred are well covered. Albeit some of the items are outdated(like a broad coverage of scenario runner which is fully replaced by Protractor) because Angular is extensively improving, it covers most of the topics you&#8217;ll ever need to know.

It&#8217;s a great manual, but it&#8217;s boring. Angular team should replace the demo application with chapters from this book. If you enjoy reading encyclopedias then this book is for you.

My score 3/5 as a book and 5/5 as a reference.
