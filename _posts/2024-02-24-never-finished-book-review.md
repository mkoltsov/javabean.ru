<p>The book is more enjoyable than the first book by David. However, I find its message weaker than the first book. </p>

<p>The first book will make you move, but this book is mostly about David being an overachiever in every possible direction.</p>

<p>It's still a great book, but that's close to TedX talk rather than the dirty empowering movement that the author brought with his first book.</p>

<p>My score 3/5</p>
