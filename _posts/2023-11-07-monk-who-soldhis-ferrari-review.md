<p>Not sure what happened with this book. Either I'm reading it late in my life of the book is completely outdated and everything it teaches you can be read in other much better books.</p>

<p>A few blog posts about contemporary pop psychology; time management and whatever the "Secret" is supposed to teach you is wrapped into a novel sprinkled with some heavy hallucinogens here. </p>

<p>In my opinition it's not worth anyone's time </p>
<p> My score is 5/5. </p>
