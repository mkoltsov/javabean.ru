Finally, after numerous hours of usage my classical Technics RP DJ 1210 headphones got tired. Earpads got worn out, they&#8217;ve started to fall down from my head.

60zl got this issue sorted out. I&#8217;ve ordered new earpads,  unfortunately they are not made out of leather but seem fine.

10 minutes of time spent and my headphones are ready to share their second decade with me!
