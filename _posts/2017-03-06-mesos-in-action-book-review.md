It covers only the basics, no details, no iternalÂ APIs, a lot of references to the Mesos documentation.

It&#8217;s worth reading if you need to quickly refresh your knowledge, besides that it&#8217;s worthless. It recommends to do Service discovery within the Mesos cluster by means of HAProxy & Mesos-DNS!!!

My score 3/5, RTFM
