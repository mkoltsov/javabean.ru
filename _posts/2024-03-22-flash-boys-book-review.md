<p>I have mixed feelings towards this book. It's both boring and entertaining. I had to skip some parts of it explaining the technical details of certain stock market operations and at the same time I craved more details on the IEX stock exchange founding story.</p>

<p>I'd rather have this book in the form of a blogpost.</p>

<p>My score 3/5</p>
