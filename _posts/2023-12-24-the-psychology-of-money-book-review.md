<p>This book will suit if you're a history buff like me. Especially, if you're interested in how economics and history can correllate and influence each other. Well, maybe not so much if you live outside of US as it's solely focused on the US economy. However, as big as it is now the massiveness of the US economy became a thing only after economies of all former hegemons failed which is relatively recent.</p>

<p>This book starts from the good and bad things that happened during the Great Depression and doesn't cover the premises of why the 19th century was so fundamental for building the world's biggest economy.</p>

<p>However, if you're not interested in the historical part of the book it can be condensed to a very few principles: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Former history won't give you answers to the questions of the future.</li>
  <li>Use common sense for decision-making, others make mistakes.</li>
  <li>Live beyond your means, no one cares what car do you drive.</li>
  <li>Those who have good money habits and perseverance will prevail no matter what failures they may face in the process.</li>
</ol>
<p> My score is 5/5. </p>
