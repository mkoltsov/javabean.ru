<p>Brave is a great browser. Nice and slick. Fast and secure. The only problem I had with it is its annoying lack of good quality third party extenstions.</p>

<p>Unfortuntely, since this week it's also prohibited to use at my work due to security reasons.</p>

<p>That's why starting from this week I'll give a try to Yandex browser on the Mac that my employer gives to me. The first impression it made was unexpectedly good, not considering the integrations with Yandex services that you need to switch off almost immediately after the browser launches as they are annoying as hell.</p>

<p>After  the last update of Git to 2.20 through brew it started to show all of its output in Russian due to some Brew misconfiguration. Yandex browser has partly the same problem, though it also could be considered as the marker of the number of non-Russian speakers using YaB or how the Yandex QA department works. Good to have a browser aimed exclusively to those who know Cyrillics =) </p>
