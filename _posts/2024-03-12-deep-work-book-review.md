<p>I don't know how it's possible but I haven't heard about this book before starting to read it and it was a 100% impulsive buy. How blind I was! It turned out to be a lowkey sleeping beauty.</p>

<p>That's a practical book that works best for people who like to be hands on with what they read. In this aspect it reminds me of "Getting Things Done" by David Allen as similarly to the latter it's instanly motivated me to use what I learned from the book in my daily life. What's also similar to GTD is that I was immediately able to reap the benefits from reading this book. </p>

<p>This book is highly practical and gives you working recipes how to be productive and live to the fullest without being constantly stressed, distracted and living in fear that you're missing something.</p>

<p>My score 5/5</p>
