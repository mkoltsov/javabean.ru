First of all i should say that i deeply appreciate what Gayle Laakman usually does. Last year i spent a lot of time on her careercup.com website. Also i&#8217;ve read another book of her, which is &#8220;Cracking the coding interview&#8221;. After that don&#8217;t blame me if i&#8217;m too much biased.</br>
  
What this book is about is obvious if you&#8217;ve read it&#8217;s title. The book is about how to write a resume to take a job in one of the top-notch tech companies of our time. There&#8217;re not so many companies every fresh grad dreams about, but the author promises that after reading this book you would certainly land on an interview in one of them.</br>
  
Is it true? If you&#8217;ve reluctantly searched for a job for a year or two this book is definitely not for you. First of all i believe that Gayle&#8217;s main audience are not-so-long-graduates or those who search for their first IT job. The main reason for that is a fact that Gayle doesn&#8217;t write anything new for an experienced job seekers. Things she says may seem obvious for those who&#8217;s got some job experience corollary some experience of searching for a new employer.</br>
  
If you&#8217;ve eagerly read all Lifehacker&#8217;s and LinkedIn job searching articles for a month or two you would get much more experience in writing a resume. But if you don&#8217;t have so much time or your skills seems a bit rusty this book is a perfect resource!</br>
  
It&#8217;s doubtfully that you can find all the recipes Gayle Laakman writes in her book in one place. I&#8217;m sure you won&#8217;t be able to read all these books or articles in a day or two. This book i&#8217;ve read for a few days. If you need a quick source for refreshing your job-placing experience i would totally recommend this book to you.

**SCORE 3/5**
