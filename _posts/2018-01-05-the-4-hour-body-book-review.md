<p>It's even more useless than the "4-hour work week". Tim is a cool guy, but the book looks like his diary with all the recipes that he has been meticiously testing on himself without any scientific or medical proof whatsoever.</p> 

<p>Don't waste your time on it, just read a few of his blog posts.</p>

<p>My score is 2/5
